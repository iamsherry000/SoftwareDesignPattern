## Homework practice
Firstly user choose how many human players and name them, AI got its own name.
Secondly choose the game they want to play.
Game could be showdown game or UNO, which have different rules, different cards...etc. (Behavioural Variation)
Template method in this homework is to free the duplicate "process".
If we will add another game in this homework, we don't need to change from current code. (Maintainability and Extensibility)
